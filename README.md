# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Description
Pathfinding visualizer is a Python application that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in action. 
The project uses PySide6 library to create the GUI and visualize pathfinding algorithms. It includes Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, Depth-First Search (DFS).
To provide better visualization and experience it contains also Recurisive Division algorithm to generate unique mazes.

## Features
- Create various sizes of grid.
- Add or remove start and end points on the grid.
- Add or remove obstacles on the grid.
- Visualize the pathfinding algorithms.
- Customize the speed of visualization.
- Reset the grid and try different algorithms.
- Generate maze on the grid.
- Save and load boards.
